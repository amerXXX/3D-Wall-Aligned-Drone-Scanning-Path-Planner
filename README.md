# 3D-Wall-Aligned-Drone-Scanning-Path-Planner
This project provides a sophisticated pipeline for autonomous drone inspection of vertical surfaces. It uses a single 2D image to perform 3D analysis of a wall, creating a robust, surface scanning path for Tello drone. The system combines AI models for segmentation and depth estimation with classical computer vision techniques for 3D reconstruction
